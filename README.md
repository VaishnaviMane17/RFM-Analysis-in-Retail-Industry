# RFM-Analysis-in-Retail-Industry
The project aimed to gain insights into customer purchasing habits using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior, we identified distinct groups, enabling us to understand loyalty, recognize high-value customers, and tailor marketing strategies to boost retention and satisfaction.
